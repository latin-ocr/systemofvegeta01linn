VEGETABLE KINGDOM. 11.

TherHAnAcTER therefore never constitutes the genue, but

isfigelf diligently to be ocmstrucsted according to the Genus
o r- ature.

. Kindred PLANTS of the same mother, are to be known in
, respect to the Genus by the {lowen or displayed plant, when
the reciprocal ,undulterated marriage leaves t'ne fruetifica-
tjon intire 3 but in the species are to be distinguished from
their fister-companion5‚ produced by a different father, ac-
cording to the Herb. ’

Thus the Dmcsosxs of a plant confists in the affinity of the
Genus, and in the difference of the Species.

The ΝᾼΜΕ of a plant therefore, that it may refer to each diag-
nosis, is double : the Generic Family Name, ’
And the Specific trivial Name,
under which'latter are the vague Synonymies of authors.

The BOTANIST3 in following the Clcgffificatiqns‚ is lead to the
named Genus by the Charafflers of the 'displayed plant or flower3
to the appellation of the Species by the Dzffiaeren'ces of the Larva
‚or herb 3 and thence to its Synonymiesv, from these to Authors,
and thence to every thing, which has come to us from our
ancestors on the subje'C’t. Thus the plant itself tells its Name,
and its History amid such a multitude of species, and of indi-
viduale 3 this is the great purpose of Botany‚ the invention of

the present age, to the completion of which all true Botanists
will contribute their labour.

27. TRUE BOTANISTS will labour to increase this lovely Science :

will constru& Fundamenta} DESCRIPTIONS in characs'teristic
words, particularly of obscure, rare, and new Flam, accord-
ing to the rule of Delineation ofa plant3 as is done by
my Son, and Schreberus in Decurii5.

· Wiss add mezm, if they are able, which represent the per-
fe& plant, such as are given by Vaillant‚ Dillenim, Ehre?³
Jacqm'n, Trew, Schnzieclcl, ἃς.

ἪἚΙ discover the most compendious and most proper specific
lFFERENCES.

Win enquire the SYNONYMIES of authors, particularly
the best3 as Hasler. · ‘

Will always prefix the natural GENUS to the Species 3 and
when new, will define it by its natural Charas‘ffer froin
the situation, figure, number, proporffion, ofan tho parts
of frufflfication.

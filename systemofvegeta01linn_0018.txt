vi. PREFACE of the TRANSLATORS.

circumstance of construction and arrangement, with
industry and sagacity almost peculias to himself, we
have transsated it, as far as might be, page for page,
and line for line: have accurately attended to his
mode of punctuation, and have introduced the astro—
nomic characters with all the numerous capital and
italic types, which are used in the original.

As LINNEUS formed numerous dzbm'nutive and com-
poztnd words from the latin and greek languageS, we
have endeavoured to construit correspondent ones
from the englilh 3 it were impossible otherwise to equal
>the conciseness and precifion of the original. We
have attempted to cornpose the former, so as to be
easily familiarised to an english ear, and intelligible
to the latin botanist3 as leaf leffet, stalk‚ stalklet‚
valve valvelet‚ tooth tootlslet, spathe spathelet‚ tube
lahela, crown coronet, calyx calycle3 of such dimi-
nutives the words tablet, circlet, bracelet, ringlet‚
rivulet, icicle, particle, are examples in daily use.
Some of the common diminutive adjeffives of the la·-
tin‚ and those formed by the prepofition sub, whose
correspondent word in english would not allow of the
termination ish, were found more difficult to manage
without periphrases, as subramosus thinly-branched.
Where they were evidently derived from the latin lan-
guage,xve have sometimes retained the particle sub.

We come now to those numerous compound words
constructed by our author in so artful a manner, as to
depicsshire such a variety of forms, of leaves, fruits,

flowers, stema seeds‚ as nolanguage was before ever, Α

made to describe. He has taken words expreffive of
well-known figures, as the words oblong and egg, and

by compounding these has given a form between tgrenl}

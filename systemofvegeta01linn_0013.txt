PREFACE ofthe TRAN‘SLATORS.

HE future improvements in AGRICULTURE, in

Ι MED1C1NE, and in many inferior ARTs, as
dying, tanning, varnissiing3 with many of the more
important Manufae'tureS, as of paper, lmen, coi-dage 3
must principally arise from the knowledge of BO-
TAN Y. For how can we ascertain the more recon-
dite properties of bodieS, without first being able to
distinguish them from each other? From the want
of this science almost all the medicineS, and many of

the arts of the ancients have been lost to their des-
cendants. ⁶

The labours of LINNEUS are generally acknow..
ledged to have best supplied this great source of future
· improvement, and yet his works have not hitherto ap·-

eared in the english language. Mr. LEE indeed in
is Introduinon to Borany has well transsated and
explained many parts of the Pkiquophia Botanica 3 ’
Dr. BERKENHOUT has given a Leaicon qf Terms ex·-
traeted from the same work3 and Mr. MrLNE has
disposed a great part of it with other botanical know-
ledge in the form of a Dz'inonary. All these labours
have their merit3 but why should not the works
themselves be transsated into our language? the con—
cise and beautiful arrangement, for which they are so
remarkable, is lost in these diffuse explanatione, of them.
Dr.

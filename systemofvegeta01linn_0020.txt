viii.. PREFACE of the TRANSLATORS

keel'd‚ saw'd, balberted‚ targeted‚ or by the com-
pounds beart-fhaped‚ egg—fhaped, moon-fhaped‚ lance-
fhaped‚ spatule-fhaped, keel-fhaped‚ saw-shaped, balbert-
fhaped, target-fhaped and the like. After having
much canvaffed the subject, We were at length re-
solved to adopt the former, 1. because the english
botanical language became thus a more exa& resem-
blance of the original ; 2. because it became thus much
more concise3 3. because fhape includes the whole
external surface, whereas the words above mentioned
mean only to express the outline osa particular seffition.
4. because when these words already compounded
with the participleshczped‚ become compounded a ,second
time, (several of which double combinations would
occur in almost every page of the work) as egg-lance-
fhaped, lance-egg-Jhaped‚ egg-heart—fhaped, beart-egg-
fhaped, they were more difficultly associated with
the ideas they were defigned to express, than the
compounds of the simple words, egg-lanced, lance-
egg'd‚ egg-hearted, heart-egg’d. We found ourselves
further under the neceffity of forming participles from
our numerical adjeetives, ufing the words two'd
three’d‚ four’d, fivdd, eighted, for the words bina,
terna, quaterna, quina, ostona 3 because binata, ter?
nata, quaternam, had previoussy been transsated by
the words twofold‚ threefold, fourfold, &c⁸ bis by twice2
duo by τωο, jugum by pair, geminus by double, ane
didymus by twin 3 and the same of the other numerals
Though some of the compound words above mentionei
are perhaps rather warped from their usual fignifica-
tions‚ yet the same objection lies against the correspor-
dent original ones of LINNEUS. His words are indeed
not claffical, they are not to be found in the worksof
Cicem, but they might have been, as Mr. Rouffeau well
observes, had Cicero written a System of Botany.

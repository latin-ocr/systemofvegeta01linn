xj PREFAC’E of the TRANSLATORS.

by his pupiIS, with greater precifion than the latin
language would allow3 thus the word dentata applied
to a root fignifies teethlike‚ applied to leaves it means
toothed3 the word end-nicked gives a more accurate
idea than the word emarginatum, the words south-turned
than adversum, and one-ranked than ficunda3 the latin
words biternatum and triternatum either mean twice and
thrice those numbers, or the square and cube of them,
and bidentatum having two leeth, or two stts of teeth.
Hence we trust that our transsation will thus refice}
the very image ofthe origina13 but, as happens in
some optical experimentS, with greater diffinstneffi,
and brighter illumination.

We have further to add, that to render this work
more extenfively useful and compleat, we have not only
transsated the SYSTEMA VEGETABILIUM pub-
lished 'oy Dr. MURRAY from the papers of the deceased
LINNEUS, containing one hundred and nineteeen ad-
ditional Genera, and variety of Species and alterations;
but have been favoured with a part of a new work now
publishing by the present Dr. LINNEUS, termed Sup-
plementztm Plantarum‚ which will describe ninety four
new Genera, with many additional Species ε the effen-
tial Characters of which we have interwoven in our
transsation in their proper places. The present ingen-
ious Professor has indeed made one alteration in the
Classes in this new work3 and that is, the omiffionof
the class polygamia, as far as his additional Genera ex·- ι
tend, which are principally plants from Surinam, and
some from Africa. These hc has placed in the other
Claffe8‚ according to their sexual distinctions 3 in which.

we have copied him.

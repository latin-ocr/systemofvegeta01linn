PREFACE of the T‘RA'NSLATORS. iii.

- of moffeS, ancl the {kin beneath the heads of muth-
' rooms. All this must be explained, whether it is

Δ represented by the word εαζγκ, or by the word 2⁴-m
polement3 which latter, though used b some of the
writers above· mentioned, is as difficult to the english

scholar, as the word calyx, is not understood by those ,

who are already acquainted with the language of
LINNEUS3 and does not affist the young Botanist in
his study of the original

So the word Leg frumen means a pod, in which all the
peas or seeds are attached to the upper edge or suture3
Sz'lzqua a pod m which they are alternately attached to
the upper and under one. If the former ¹should be
tert-ned fhell, and the latter pod, they must still be
defined3 and thus the meaning of them would be as
difficult to acquire by the english reader as that of the
words leo 0·‚umen and filiqua3 and would be so unin-

,telligibleo to the latin Botanist‚ that they could not oon
vest· tog aethar.

Hence we have retained the words calyx for flower-
cup3 corol for bloflom3 stamen for chive3 psszl fot
pointal3 perzcarp for fruit veffel3 and some other
technical terms3 such as would necqffarigy be used m arg⁴
engl fh conversation by Botansts acquamted with the
origmal of L1NNEUS3 to these words We found it
neceffary to give english terminatione, because their
'diminutives and their participles frequently occur in
the course of the work, and they are sometimes com
pounded with other words3 thus eorolla is transsated
Corol, petalum Pet zl anthesa Anther, panicula Pa722',cle

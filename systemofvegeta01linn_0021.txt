PREFACE of the TRANSLATORS. ix.
The second difficulty waS‚ whether some of' these

compound words should be used as adjefft'ves or as par-
ticiples pqffl've3 as in some of them the signification
differs with this difference oftheir construction3 thus
’ a threadform fiowerstem is one every where of equal
thickness like a thread, but a thread-formed flowerstem
would mean one formed of thread; so 'axe-form means
of the form of an axe, but axe-formed would mean
formed by an axe 3 a threejoldgarment means a tripple
garment, but a three-folded garment would mean
thrice folded3 a threefoot rule is one of the length of

three feet, but a three-sbot‘ed stool is one having three .

feet. After much deliberation‚ and by the advice of
our ingenious friends we at length resolved to use these
words, and a few othere, adjestively5 because their
precise signification was thus better ascertained, and
they became more euphonious from their being
less loaded with consonants, and our language affords
many instances of compound words of similar construc-
tion. Thus a grit-stone wall, a hair-breadth scape, a
broad—eloth coat‚ foot-path way, small-tooth comb,
one-horse· chair, two-man beetle, three-foot rule,
four-mile stone, five-card 100, fix-penny loaf, ten-
pound weight, twenty-[hilling bill, fifty—gun {hip5
to these may be added the words uniform, multiform,
two-sold, manifold, blindfold, and the words com-
pounded with like, wife, full, and some; as castle-like,
cross-wise, spoonful, burthensome; all which are
used as adjectives either in familiar conversation, or by
respectable writerS.

By this aptness of our language in compounding
variety of words, we flatter ourselves that we have
been able to express in some instances the meaning
Qf our author, as explained and definedby himself or

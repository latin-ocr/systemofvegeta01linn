PREFACE of the TRANSLATORS. vii.

η both3 which new form partakes more of the egg, if
ῥ’ that word precedes in the compound, as egg-obl072g3
or more of the oblong, if that word precedes, as oblong-
egg'd. Hence these two words are made to represent
forms offour kinds very nearly allied3 but to these he
has added oval, and elltptic, and again compounded
these with oblong and egg, and has thus, as it were,
conjured up before our eyes the outlines of forms as
numerous and as accurate by the magic of a few words,
as the pencil alone was thought capable ofproducing.
, Our readers will perceive, that to equal all these niceties
¹ of combination with precision and conciseness in our
Ἴ transsation was an undertaking that required some
degree of hardiness; this was the Gorgon-feature, that
had hitherto frozen the defigns, or blasted the progress
of all, who looked upon this giant Naturalist, and
y deterred them 'from the encounter.

ἵ In the const1·u6tion of these numerous and difficult
compound words we have laboured their conciseness
and distinctness, as our author has done, rather than the
elegance of their combinations5 and as our language
allows of great variety ofcornpound words, and those
terminating either as substantiveS, adjectives, verbs,
or participles both active and paffive, we have found
it as well adapted to this purpose as the latin, and
’ perhaps not much less so than the greek. We had
great difficulty however in determining the two follow-
·ng circumstances, about which we consulted many of
‘our ingenious friends. The fi'i‘st waS‚ whether the la„
tin words cordatum, ovatum, lunatum, lanceolarum,
statulatum, carinatum, serratum, hastarum, pellatam,
and the like, expreffive of the forms of leaves, would
better be transsated by their correspondent englissi
wordS, hearted, egg'd‚ moon'd, lamed, spatuled‚
keel’d

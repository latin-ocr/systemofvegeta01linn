the like. For the explanation of these we refer the
reader to the BOTANICAL TERMS AND DEFI-
NITIONS prefixed to this wo‘rk5 which we have
transsated from a thefis of Dr. ELMGREN, written
under the eye of L1NNEus‚and publiihed by him 111
the fixth volume of the Amaenitates Academicae.

The determining the exa& number of these wordS,
neceffary to be naturalised into our language, was a
taik of much nicety and consideration. We were
afraid of rendering our work difficult to the english
reader, if we introduced many innovations, or did
much violence to our vernacular tongue 3 or of making
it unintelligible to the latin Botanist‚ if we were too

⁴ parsimonious in the engraftment or transplantation of

exotic terms. We hope we have steered between these
two extremes, for ,we have had the opinion of
many and of skilful pilots to direct our voyage3 the ce-
lebrated Mr. Rossmu, in a Posthumous Botanical
work had adopted a fimilar plan3 and has attempted
to naturalise into the french language many of the
technical words of LINNEUS 3 as corymbe, pant'cle, cyme,
filique, ſslicle, spathe, perianth, and many other8‚
which we hope will not be more diffonant to an eng-
mh ear than to a french one.

LrNNEUs has arranged the individuaIS, or Species,
of vegetables into families, or Genera, and these again
into Orders and Claffl’s: As there are so few generzc
names in our language‚ we have universally adopted those
of our author, thus the words Tertzcum Hordeum,
Avena, Secale are family names; which include variety
oi other grasseS, as well as the 'VVheau Barley, OatS,
and Rye‚ which we cultivate for our food: the generic

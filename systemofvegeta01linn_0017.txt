PREFACE of the TRANSLATORS. v-

· ,name Amygdczlus includes the Peach as well as the
Almond3 Prunus includes the Cherry, Apricot, and
Laurel‚ as well as the Plum3 and Pyrus the Apple,
sweet-flower'd Crab, and the Qince, as well as the
Pecu-5 whence it would have been productive of much
confusion to have given any of these english names to
families, which belong to individuale. The english
generic names however, which are well established,
we have occafionally added in italice after the latin

Α ones. In respect to the individuals or Species qulcznts

we have, by the advice of many of our botanical cor-
respondents, retained the Trivial Name used by LIN-
⁴NEUS ς, as it is become a kind ofcognomen along with
⁴the generic name 3 and where it is expreffive of any pe-
culiarity of the plant, we have transsated it by an equi-
valent englilh word. The Qcotcztions from other works
we have placed in the index-form, as our author has
dg'ffiostd them3 and have added the best received engljfh
namesin their proper places from M1LLER, HUDsoN,
LIGHTFooT, &c. and referred to them in our Index

of S ynozzymies.

The learned reader will perceive, that we have made

a ssight change in the construction of the sexual dis-
tinctions of the Claffes on account of the greater deli-
cacy of modern language; hence the wordS, one male,
and one-female, are used in preference to one virility
one feminality. In regard to the general language,
we have·endeavoured to copy that of LINNEUS with
the most scrupulous exactnes83 for as this illustrious
Naturalist may be said to have formed a language,
rather than to have found one, suitable to his purpose3
and appears to have studied every part of his work,
from the great outline of the system to the most minute
2 circumstance
